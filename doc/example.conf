# ircd.conf  configuration file for Nefarious IRCu 1.2.0
#
# Last Updated:  29, February 2008.
#
# Written originaly by Niels <niels@undernet.org>, updated by the 
# Nefarious IRCu team.
#
# Updated and heavily modified by Braden <dbtem@yahoo.com>.
#
# Thanks and credits to: Run, Trillian, Cym, Morrissey, Chaos, Flynn,
#                        Xorath, WildThang, Mmmm, SeKs, Ghostwolf and
#                        all other Undernet IRC Admins and Operators,
#                        and programmers working on the Undernet ircd.
#
# This is an example of the configuration file used by Nefarious IRCu.
#
# All configuration options start with a letter identifying the option,
# and a colon separated list of options. Unused fields should be left
# blank.
#
# Please note that when ircd puts the configuration lines into practice,
# it parses them exactly the other way round than they are listed here.
# It reads the lines in reverse order.
#
# This means that you should start your I: lines with the "fall through",
# most vanilla one and end with the most detailed.
#
# There is a difference between the "hostname" and the "server name"
# of the machine that the server is run on. For example, the host can
# have "veer.cs.vu.nl" as FQDN, and "Amsterdam.NL.AfterNET.Org" as
# server name.
# A "server mask" is something like "*.NL.AfterNET.Org", which is
# matched by "Amsterdam.NL.AfterNET.Org" but not by
# "Pyro.US.AfterNET.Org".
#
# Please do NOT just rename the example.conf to ircd.conf and expect
# it to work.


# [INCLUDES]
#
# include:</optional/path/file.conf>
#
# If you find your ircd.conf is getting too large or wish to seperate it
# out into files, you can with includes. Below are some examples. The path
# to the file is optional. But if you dont include the path then the ircd
# will check the dir where ircd.conf is for the file.
#
# include:extra.conf
# include:/path/to/extra.conf
#
# Currently if you use linesync then it will not check or know about file
# includes.


# [M:line]
#
# First some information about the server.
# M:<server name>:<virtual host>:<description>:<not used>:<server numeric>
#
# <virtual host> must contain either a * or a valid IPv4 address in
# dotted quad notation. (127.0.0.1) The address MUST be the address
# of a physical interface on the host. This address is used for outgoing
# connections only, see P:lines for listener virtual hosting.
# If in doubt put a * or the IP of your primary interface here.
# The server must be compiled with virtual hosting turned on to get this
# to work correctly.
#
# Note that <server numeric> has to be unique on the network your server
# is running on, must be between 0 and 4095, and is not updated on a rehash.
M:Amsterdam.NL.AfterNET.Org::Amsterdam AfterNET Server::1


# [A:line]
#
# This sets information that can be retrieved with the /ADMIN command.
# It should contain at least an admin Email contact address.

# [Y:lines]
#
# All connections to the server are associated with a certain "connection
# class", be they incoming or outgoing (initiated by the server), be they
# clients, servers or Martians. (Note that ircd doesn't have direct support
# for Martians (yet?); they will have to register as normal users. ;-)
# Take the following Y: lines only as a guide.
# Y:<class>:<ping freq>:<connect freq>:<maximum links>:<sendq size>
#
# <connect freq> applies only to servers, and specifies the frequency 
# that the server tries to autoconnect. setting this to 0 will cause
# the server to attempt to connect repeatedly with no delay until the 
# <maximum links> condition is satisfied. This is a Bad Thing(tm).
#
# <maximum links> should be set at either 0 or 1.
#
# Server classes: 90 = all your uplinks for who you do not wish to hub;
# 80 = leaf servers (only used if your server is a hub)
Y:90:90:300:1:9000000
Y:80:90:300:0:9000000

# Client classes. 10 = locals; 2 = for all .net and .com that are not
# in Europe; 1 = for everybody.

# [I:lines]
#
# To allow clients to connect, they need authorization. This can be
# done based on hostmask, address mask, and/or with a password.
# With intelligent use of classes and the maxconnections field in the
# Y: lines, you can let in a specific domain, but get rid of all other
# domains in the same toplevel, thus setting up some sort of "reverse
# K: line".
# I:<IP mask or crap to force resolving>:<opt passwd>:<hostmask>::<class>
#
# Technical description (for examples, see below):
# For every connecting client, the IP address is known.  A reverse lookup
# on this IP-number is done to get the (/all) hostname(s).
# Each hostname that belongs to this IP-number is matched to <hostmask>,
# and the I: line is used when any matches; the client will then show
# with this particular hostname.  If none of the hostnames match, then
# the IP-number is matched against the <IP mask ...> field, if this matches
# then the I: line is used nevertheless and the client will show with the
# first (main) hostname if any; if the IP-number did not resolve then the
# client will show with the dot notation of the IP-number.
# There is a special case for the UNIX domain sockets and localhost connections
# though; in this case the <IP mask ...> field is compared with the
# name of the server (thus not with any IP-number representation). The name
# of the server is the one returned in the numeric 002 reply, for example:
# 002 Your host is 2.undernet.org[jolan.ppro], running version ...
# Then the "jolan.ppro" is the name used for matching.
# Therefore, unix domain sockets, and connections to localhost would
# match this I: line:
# I:jolan.ppro::foobar::1
# Finally, I: lines with empty <IP mask ..> or <hostmask> fields are skipped.
#
# This is the "fallback" entry. All .uk, .nl, and all unresolved are
# in these two lines.
# By using two different lines, multiple connections from a single IP
# are only allowed from hostnames which have both valid forward and
# reverse DNS mappings.

# You can put a digit (0..9) in the password field, which will make ircd
# only accept a client when the total number of connections to the network
# from the same IP number doesn't exceed this number.
# The following example would accept at most one connection per IP number
# from "*.swipnet.se" and at most two connections from dial up accounts
# that have "dial??.*" as host mask:
# I:Resolved:1:*@*.swipnet.se::1
# I:Resolved:2:*@dial??.*::1

# One of the many nice features in Nefarious is "Uworld", a program
# connected to the net as a server. This allows it to broadcast any mode
# change, thus allowing opers to, for example, "unlock" a channel that
# has been taken over.
# There is only one slight problem: the TimeStamp protocol prevents this.
# So there is a configuration option to allow them anyway from a certain
# server.

#
# As of ircu2.10.05 is it possible to Jupe nicks. Juped nicks need to be
# added to U: lines.  As per CFV-0095, the following nicks must be juped,

# [K:lines]
#
# While running your server, you will most probably encounter individuals
# or groups of persons that you do not wish to have access to your server.
#
# For this purpose, the ircd understands "kill lines".
# K:<host/IP mask>:"<opt reason>":<username mask>
#
# It is possible to use a file as comment for the ban.
# K:<host/IP mask>:!<path to file>:<usermask>
#
# The default reason is: "You are banned from this server"
# Note that K: lines are local to the server; if you ban a person or a
# whole domain from your server, they can get on IRC via any other server
# that doesn't have them K: lined (yet).
#
# With a simple comment, using quotes:
K:*.au:"Please use a nearer server":*
K:*.edu:"Please use a nearer server":*

# With a file, prepending a '!' before the filename.
# The file can contain for example, a reason, a link to the
# server rules and a contact address.

# even if an IP address has a properly resolving host name.

# [C:lines]
#
# You probably want your server connected to other servers, so your users
# have other users to chat with.
# IRC servers connect to other servers forming a network with a star or
# tree topology. Loops are not allowed.
# In this network, two servers can be distinguished: "hub" and "leaf"
# servers. Leaf servers connect to hubs; hubs connect to each other.
# Of course, many servers can't be directly classified in one of these
# categories. Both a fixed and a rule-based decision making system for
# server links is provided for ircd to decide what links to allow, what
# to let humans do themselves, and what links to (forcefully) disallow.
#
# The Connection lines (also known as C lines)
# define what servers the server connect to, and which servers are
# allowed to connect.
# C:<remote hostname or IP>:<password>:<remote server name>:<port>:<class>
#
# The "port" field defines the default port the server tries to connect
# to if an operator uses /connect without specifying a port. This is also
# the port used when the server attempts to auto-connect to the remote 
# server. (See Y:lines for more informationa about auto-connects).
#
# Our primary uplink.
C:1.2.3.4:passwd:Amsterdam.NL.AfterNET.Org:4400:90


# [H:lines]
#
# If your server starts on a bit larger network, you'll probably get
# assigned one or two uplinks to which your server can connect.
# If your uplink(s) also connect to other servers than yours (which is
# probable), you need to define your uplink as being allowed to "hub".
# H:<allowed hostmask>::<server name>:<maximum hops that can be introduced>
H:*.*::Amsterdam.NL.AfterNET.Org


# [L:lines]
#
# Of course, the opposite is also possible: forcing a server to be
# a leaf. L: lines follow Murphy's Law: if you use them, there's a big
# chance that routing will be screwed up afterwards.
# L:<opt disallowed hostmask>::<server mask>:<opt max depth>


# [D:lines]

# [O:lines]
#
# Inevitably, you have reached the part about "IRC Operators". Oper status
# grants some special privileges to a user, like the power to make the
# server break or (try to) establish a connection with another server,
# and to "kill" users off IRC.
# I can write many pages about this; I will restrict myself to saying that
# if you want to appoint somebody as IRC Operator on your server, that
# person should be aware of his/her responsibilities, and that you, being
# the admin, will be held accountable for their actions.
#
# There are two sorts of IRC Operators: "local" and "global". Local opers
# can squit, connect and kill - but only locally: their +o user mode
# is not not passed along to other servers.
#
# Depending on some defines in include/config.h, local operators are also
# not allowed to /DIE and /RESTART the server.
# Local operators are designated with a lowercase 'o'
# O:<host/IP mask>:<encrypted password>:<Nick>:<flags>:<connection class>
# o:<host/IP mask>:<encrypted password>:<Nick>:<flags>:<connection class>
#
# There are 2 types of flags currently which will only work if the OPERFLAGS
# is enabled. When the feature is disabled, the flags are ignored.
#
# O - Global Operator
# A - IRC Administrator
#
# The encrypted password is optional.  If you wish to encrypt your password,
# there is a utility in the ircd.  Please read the file tools/README.  
O:*@*.cs.vu.nl:VRKLKuGKn0jLs:Niels::10

# If you want to use a more secure password authentication system then
# Generate a 1024bit RSA key, specify the path to the key as the password
# and add R as the oper flag. This will use the CHALLENGE system instead of
# /OPER. See doc/challenge.txt for more information.

O:*@somehost.co.nz:/home/irc/keys/vulcan.key:vulcan:R:10

# Note that the <connection class> is optional, but leaving it away
# puts the O: lines in class 0, which usually only accepts one connection
# at a time.  If you want users to Oper up more then once per O: line,
# then use a connection class that allows more then one connection,
# for example (using class 10 as in the example above):
#
# Once you OPER your connection class changes no matter where you are or
# your previous connection classes.  If the defined connection class is 10
# for the O:line, then your new connection class is 10.

# [B:lines]
# These are lines intended to improve the generic irc users ability to
# use network services. Each line sets up a /<service> alias so that
# users may type that instead of a full /msg command.
#
# for example.. adding:
## B:X2:X2@X2.AfterNET.Services:*
# would result in commands like this being possible
## /X2 HELP

# B:X2:X2@X2.AfterNET.Services:*
# B:AUTH:AuthServ@OperServ.AfterNET.Services:"AUTH"


# [b:lines]
# Note lowercase b. These lines will enable the server to forward any

# allow users to use the services without the services being in channel.
#
# b:<prefix>:<server>

# When your server gets more full, you will notice delays when trying to
# connect to your server's primary listening port. It is possible via the
# Port lines to specify additional ports for the ircd to listen to.
# De facto ports are: 6667 - standard; 6660-6669 - additional client
# ports;
# We suggest 4400 for server listener ports.
# These are just hints, they are in no way official IANA or IETF policies.
# IANA says we should use port 194, but that requires us to run as root, so
# we don't do that.
#
# P:<hostmask>:<interface>:<[CES][H]>:<port number>
#
# The hostmask setting allows you to specify a range of IP addresses that
# you will allow connections from. This should only contain IP addresses
# and '*' if used. This field only uses IP addresses. This does not use
# DNS in any way so you can't use it to allow *.nl or *.uk. Attempting
# to specify anything other than numbers, dots and stars [0-9.*] will result
# in the port allowing connections from anyone.
#
# The interface setting allows multiply homed hosts to specify which
# interface to use on a port by port basis, if an interface is not specified
# the default interface will be used. The interface MUST be the complete
# IP address for a real hardware interface on the machine running ircd.
# If you want to use virtual hosting *YOU* *MUST* *USE* *THIS* otherwise it
# WILL bind to all interfaces - not what most people seem to expect.
#
# The [CES][H] field is an optional field to specify that a port is a
# server port or a client port and whether it's hidden or not.
# If used the first character MUST be either a C, E, or S.
# If you want to hide a port from /stats p from non-opers follow the C
# or S with an H
#
# C = Client (Ports 6660-6669)
# E = Encrypted SSL (Port 7000)
# S = Server (Port 4400)
# X = Setting this to yes makes the port exempt from connection restrictions
#     during a timed /restart or /die.
#
# Encrypted SSL connections are for client connections ONLY!

# you place the rejection message in "quotes". Rejection messages are limited
# in length, currently they cant be all that long but that is being worked on. The
# rejected users nick, username, ip, and host can be placed into the rejection
# message by using these codes:
#
# %n - Nickname
# %u - Username
# %h - Hostname
# %i - IP Address
#
# The rank number must be unique over all X:Lines, the higher the number- the more
# rank it has. The highest ranking X:Line which is matched against a user will
# get its name marked in the hostname.
#
# Example:
#
# X:dnsbl.sorbs.net:"sorbs.net":r:1,3,4:"%n!%u@%h Found On Sorbs DNSBL http://www.dnsbl.us.sorbs.net/cgi-bin/lookup?IP=%i":1
#
# This will reject clients who get a return addresses of 1,3 and 4 off
# dnsbl.sorbs.net. Sample rejection message:
#
# "bloggs!someident@google.com Found On Sorbs DNSBL http://www.dnsbl.us.sorbs.net/cgi-bin/lookup?IP=111.222.111.222"
#
# BITMASK Example:
#
# X:dnsbl.dnsbl.net:"dnsbl.net":b:1,3,5:"%n!%u@%h Found On DNSBL":2
#
# I reccomend you take advantage of ircd.conf includes and list your X:Lines in
# a seperate file as it could be quite a large list.
#
# Notes: MAKE SURE you read the DNSBL website before you go ahead and use it
# as they may have rules for large sites/servers who use them. If you do not
# wish to use DNSBL checking then simply do not set any X:lines. I only
# reccomend that you use one DNSBL, due to the amount of time it will take to
# connect with multiple DNSBL's.


# [F:lines]
#
# IRC servers have a large number of options and features.  Most of these
# are set at compile time through the use of #define's--see "make config"
# for more details--but we are working to move many of these into the
# configuration file.  Feature lines are the hook we're using for this.
# F:<Option>:<Value>
#
# The entire purpose of F:lines are so that you do not have to recompile
# the IRCD everytime you want to change a feature.  All of the features
# are listed below, and at the bottom is how to set logging.
#
# A Special Thanks to Kev for writing the documentation of F:lines.  It can
# be found at doc/readme.features and the logging documentation can be
# found at doc/readme.log.
#

# These F:lines should always be enabled, as they are the only way to
# log some errormessages in case the server dies because of an out of 
# memory problem. 
# For more information about logging, read doc/readme.log
