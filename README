We apologize if we have missed an IRCd or tool in the list.
If you see parts of your code being used in Nefarious and do not see 
your IRCd/tool above, please contact one of the developers of Nefarious.

If you are running the development version of Nefarious IRCu on a 
production network, you are doing so at your own peril. We take NO 
RESPONSIBILITY for ANYTHING it might do on your network. We strongly 
recommend that you do NOT run the development version on a production 
network! You have been warned.

- *IMPORTANT NOTICE* --------------------------------------------------

Do NOT ask for support for Nefarious IRCu in #coder-com on Undernet.
The official support channel for Nefarious IRCu is on the AfterNET IRC
Network (irc.afternet.org) in #evilnet. #coder-com on Undernet is ONLY
for normal IRCu and GNUWorld. If you have found bugs in Nefarious IRCu,
do NOT submit them to coder-com@undernet.org or to the undernet-ircu
SourceForge site. Send them to any of the Nefarious IRCu mailing lists
or the Nefarious IRCu SourceForge project site. If you submit a bug
and we find out it's a bug which affects undernet-ircu, then we will
forward the report on.

- ssl notes -----------------------------------------------------------

If you have enabled SSL (--enable-ssl) then no doubt you will want to
use port 994 for your SSL port, as it is standard. You should know that
non-root users can't use ports under 1024 and the ircd wont run as root,
so this becomes an issue. This can be fixed with the Bounce tool
(tools/Bounce). You will need to have root access for this to work.

cd tools/Bounce
./build
edit bounce.conf (you will see a ssl example at the bottom)

P:192.168.10.5:994:192.168.10.1:8000

What this line will do is, bind port 994 to 192.168.10.5 and any
connections received on it will be fowarded to 192.168.10.1 port 8000, 
port 8000 being a ssl configured port on the ircd (E).

More Examples

P:210.55.131.133:994:210.55.131.133:7000
P:123.123.123.123:994:203.86.91.12:6665

after the bounce.conf is done run
./bounce &

If you wish to run bounce in another dir then either copy the Bounce 
dir out or copy the bounce binary and bounce.conf to another directory 
and run.

- installation ---------------------------------------------------------

(see ./configure --help for a range of compile time options)
./configure
make
make install
(ircd.pem generation will be prompted if ircd.pem doesnt exist, assuming
 ssl is enabled, this is skipped if its disabled.)

- cygwin installation --------------------------------------------------

see README.Cygwin (CYGWIN IS UNSUPPORTED)

- configuration --------------------------------------------------------

cd /home/ircduser/lib
nano example.conf (or vi, pico, ee, etc. :)
mv example.conf ircd.conf

Note: to compile mkpasswd do this:
cd tools
make -f Makefile.crypt

- running --------------------------------------------------------------

cd /home/ircduser/bin
./ircd

If all goes well the ircd should run. If not, check your ircd.conf
CAREFULLY for errors.

- crashes --------------------------------------------------------------

If your nefarious has crashed then check your dir containing ircd.conf
firstly (default ~/lib). In that dir _hopefully_ is a core file, the
format of name filename will be ircd.DATE.core. Take note of DATE and
go into your dir containing the ircd binary (default ~/bin). In this dir
do this:

ls | grep DATE

You should get a result, now you will have 2 files:

ircd.DATE.core
ircd.DATE

The dates on both files may not match by one number at the end, dont
worry. Now do this:

tar -xcf ~/corefiles.tar.gz /path/to/ircd.DATE.core /path/to/ircd.DATE

Look in your home directory for corefiles.tar.gz and email this to any
email address in the Nefarious coders section towards the top of this
document, along with a description of what you were doing at the time
of the crash on the server. If you know how to reproduce it then tell
us how.
